## Features

Our AI Comic Generator is a powerful tool that leverages OpenAI's DALL路E and ChatGPT to transform text files into engaging comic instructions. Here are some key features:

1. **Text-to-Comic Conversion**: Our app takes text files uploaded by users and converts them into instructions that ChatGPT understands. These instructions are then used to generate comics using DALL路E's image generation capabilities.

2. **Education Enhancement**: Designed with education in mind, our app can transform traditional and often mundane textbook information into visually engaging comics. This approach aims to captivate the interest of younger learners who are accustomed to consuming short videos and graphics.

3. **Novel to Manga Conversion**: For fans of fan fiction, our app offers a unique feature. It allows a small but loyal fanbase to turn their favorite fan fiction stories into manga. This feature caters to the desires of fans who are willing to pay to see their favorite stories come to life in a visual format.
